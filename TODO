LibPlay TODO -- Tasks that need implementing.

* KNOWN BUGS

  + lib/lp-scene.c: Handle window closing gracefully.

    When the video sink window is closed the sink posts an error to
    pipeline.  Currently, we're not handling this error---the application
    simply crashes due to an unmet assertion.  We should handle this error
    by destroying the scene.

* FEATURES OR PROBLEMS

  + lib/lp-scene.c: Use fakesrc to generate a blank video stream in scene.

    Currently, we're using videotestsrc for this job, which is overkill.
    Moreover, it cannot generate a transparent stream.  We should use the
    fakesrc element, e.g.,

      gst-launch-1.0 fakesrc filltype=2 format=3
      ! capsfilter
        caps="video/x-raw,format=ARGB,framerate=0/1,width=800,height=600"
      ! videoconvert ! imagefreeze ! compositor name=comp sink_0::alpha=0
      ! autovideosink videotestsrc ! comp.

  + lib/lp-scene.c, lib/lp-media.c: Expose text properties

    The textoverlay element has lots of properties to control the appearance
    and position of the overlaid text.  We should expose these as
    proprieties in the lp_Scene and lp_Media APIs.

  + lib/lp-media.c: Add support to URIs pointing to text files.

    We should use the textrender element to render text files, e.g.,

      gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=TEXT-FILE
      ! capsfilter caps=text/x-raw,format=utf8 ! textrender ! imagefreeze
      ! compositor ! videoconvert ! xvimagesink

  + Generate API documentation using gtk-doc.

    Cf. GLib sources.

* OPTIMIZATION AND CLEAN UP

  + tests/test-lp-media-start-fail.c: Check leaks reported by Valgrind.
